## 📦 Application of OOP Principles

### Encapsulation
- User and hotel details are encapsulated in their respective classes (User, Room, Hotel).
- Modifications to data, such as the user's balance or room availability, can only occur via defined methods like setBalance() and setAvailable().

### Inheritance
- General classes (e.g., `Person`) serve as base classes for specific entities like `User`.
- This allows shared attributes and methods to be reused, enabling consistent behavior and reducing code duplication.

### Polymorphism
- Overridden methods (e.g., toString() in Room and Booking) ensure tailored behavior for specific entities.
- The showAvailableRooms method in Hotel dynamically adapts behavior based on the runtime data (e.g., room type or user balance).

### Abstraction
- Simplifies complex operations, such as managing bookings and user authentication, by exposing only essential functionalities.
- `BookingManager` abstracts the process of adding bookings to the database, including time zone conversions, ensuring that these details are hidden from the main application logic.

## 🏗 System Design

### Class Overview:
| **Class Name**          | **Responsibility**                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `Main`                  | Entry point for the system.       |
| `User`                  | Manages user details, balance generation, authentication, and session information.|
| `Hotel`                 | Handles room listings, availability checks, and room booking functionality. |
| `Room`                  | Represents room details and provides methods for updating room status. |
| `Booking`               | Stores and manages booking details, including check-in/check-out times and total price. |
| `DatabaseConnection`    | Ensures secure storage and retrieval of user and booking data. |
