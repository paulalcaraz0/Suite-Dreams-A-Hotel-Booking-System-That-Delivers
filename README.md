## 📦 Application of OOP Principles

### Encapsulation
- User and hotel details are encapsulated in their respective classes.
- Modifications to data can only occur via defined methods.

### Inheritance
- General classes (e.g., `Person`) serve as base classes for specific entities like `User`.

### Polymorphism
- Overridden methods (e.g., `calculateTotal`) ensure tailored behavior.

### Abstraction
- Simplifies complex operations, exposing only essential functionalities.
